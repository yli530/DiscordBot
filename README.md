This is a discord bot that has a bunch of random commands that I made for the sake of learning about api and using them

I work on this project on and off over the course of 2 months.

If you for some reason want to use it, change the name of conf.json to config.json and fill out the stuff inside.
token: the discord bot token
twtKey, twtSecret, accessTok, accessSecret: twitter api tokens
malClient: mal api token
Then you can just use node to run it

If you want to use the code in this project feel free, just credit me or link to this repo(though I don't think my code is super great)
